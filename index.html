        <p>Hey, I'm Lee (you know that, we've met).</p>
        <p>I'm a big nerd, and I'm particularly fond of <s>old</s> <em>...retro</em> video games.</p>
        <p>Recently, I discovered the retro gaming handheld scene and learned that it's possible to fit decades of gaming history onto a single device. I thought to myself, "Wouldn't that make a great gift?"</p>
        <p>Oddball is a great company full of great people, and working for Oddball has made my life better in a lot of ways. So I felt it would be nice to give back to some of those people that helped make my experience at Oddball great.</p>
        <p>You're one of those people, so please accept this gift!</p>

        <h2>Wait, so what is this thing again?<br>ðŸŽ®</h2>
        <div class="center">
          <p>These devices are called "retro handhelds", but basically it's a tiny Linux computer that runs emulation software for older video game consoles.</p>
          <p>There are a wide variety of different brands, components, and form factors out there for retro handhelds, but I picked one that I believe balances performance, portability, cost, and ease-of-use.</p>
          <p>This specific device is called the Miyoo Mini Plus, onto which I've installed a custom firmware called <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion">Onion OS</a>. I've also installed somewhere around 10,000 arcade and console games from Atari on up to Playstation 1.</p>
          <p>There's also some ports of PC games included under the PORTS folder. In there you'll find fun stuff like Doom, Duke Nukem, Cave Story, and even a port of Diablo 1 (<a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Game-Controller-Scheme">here's the controls for that</a>).</p>
          <p>For the most part, using the device is fairly straightforward. You can find the controls for Onion <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Global-Shortcuts">here</a>. If you want to dig deeper, <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Features">here's the Onion OS feature list and more info</a>. In general though, you should just be able to power it on and jump into your favorite game without much fuss.</p>

        <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Q&A</h2> 
        <ul class="center">
          <li>
            <p>Did you use Divvy or company money to do this?</p>
            <p>No, I paid for everything out-of-pocket. I did not receive any funding from Oddball whatsoever, so please don't harass Luke (at least about this&mdash;go wild on your Divvy questions, he loves those).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why did you do this?</p>
            <p>It started out as a project for groomsmen in my wedding that led to some extra devices (or not enough groomsmen if you want to look at it that way). Oddball has also had various unofficial swag projects throughout the years, so I figured this made sense as both a nice thing to do and a way to keep the swag tradition going.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why didn't everyone get one?</p>
            <p>While I would have loved to make more, the whole package including shipping costed around $200 per device, so I was limited in how many I could make and send out. I tried to choose fellow game enthusiasts that I knew would enjoy them. <br><br>Please don't be offended if you or someone you know didn't get one.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How do I exit and/or save a game?</p>
            <p>You can save games that have a save feature normally. However, if you use the power button and shut the device off, it will save and then resume the game when you power the device back on.<br><br>You can manually save/load game states by entering the Retroarch menu by holding the menu button and pressing select. You can get out of Retroarch by using the "resume" option in that menu.<br><br>If you want to exit a game, you can use the menu button to return to the menu, which should also create a save state (Note that this won't work for games in the "Arcade" category, which must be saved/loaded manually).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What are these leather cases?</p>
            <p>I commissioned a leatherworker to create custom leather cases that I designed. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/deathRATTLER">You can find his store here if you'd like to hire him.</a> Aside from looking cool, the case should protect the device from getting scuffed up in a bag or in your pocket. Just be careful not to forget it's in your back pocket and sit on it on accident or something.<br><br>The stamp on the back is because Oddball is a "Strangely Human" digital agency (You know, the kind of place where this type of thing happens). The quarter is because the device plays arcade games and Oddball is a federal contractor. Synergy. BOOM</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do I need a screen protector?</p>
            <p>There should be one included in the box for you to apply. I would also recommend inserting the device into the case with the screen facing away from the magnetic enclosure just in case.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why are there no Nintendo 64 games?</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the device doesn't really have enough horsepower to emulate N64. Also, the controls don't really support the N64 control scheme. <br><br>However, Super Mario 64 was compiled from source recently (with modified controls) and I was at least able to include that under the PORTs section.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why is there an extra SD card included?</p>
            <p>That is the original SD card the device came with. The quality control on those original cards is spotty and the included operating system leaves a lot to be desired. I upgraded the card on each device to a reputable brand and installed a custom linux firmware that is better supported and regularly updated.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I'm interested in this retro gaming thing, tell me more.</p>
            <p>Cool, ping me on Slack and we can talk. You can also check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps YouTube channel</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How can I thank you?</p>
            <p>Just have fun with it and let me know if you enjoy it. You can also maybe be more active in the #vidya-games channel.</p>
