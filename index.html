        <p>Hey, I'm Lee (you know that, we've met).</p>
        <p>I'm a big nerd, and I'm particularly fond of <s>old</s> <em>...retro</em> video games.</p>
        <p>Recently, I discovered the retro handheld scene and learned that it's possible to fit decades of gaming history onto a single device. I thought to myself, "Wouldn't that make a great gift?"</p>
        <p>Oddball is a great company full of great people, and working for Oddball has made my life better in a lot of ways. So I felt it would be nice to give back to some of those people that helped make my experience at Oddball great.</p>
        <p>You're one of those people, so please accept this gift!</p>

        <h2>Wait, so what is this thing again?<br>ðŸŽ®</h2>
        <div class="center">
          <p>These devices are called "retro handhelds", but basically it's a tiny Linux computer that runs emulation software for older video game consoles.</p>
          <p>There are a wide variety of different brands, components, and form factors out there, but I picked one that balances performance, portability, cost, and ease-of-use.</p>
          <p>This specific device is called the Miyoo Mini Plus, onto which I've installed a custom firmware called <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion">Onion OS</a>. I've also installed somewhere around 10,000 arcade and console games from Atari on up to Playstation 1.</p>
          <p>There's also some ports of PC games included under the PORTS folder. In there you'll find fun stuff like Doom, Duke Nukem, Cave Story, and even a port of Diablo 1 (<a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Game-Controller-Scheme">here's the controls for that</a>).</p>
          <p>For the most part, using the device is fairly straightforward. You can find the controls for Onion <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Global-Shortcuts">here</a>. If you want to dig deeper, <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Features">here's the Onion OS feature list and more info</a>. In general though, you should just be able to power it on and jump into your favorite game without much fuss.</p>

        <h2>Q&A</h2> 
        <ul class="center">
          <li>
            <p>Did you use Divvy or company money to do this?</p>
            <p>No, I paid for everything out-of-pocket. I did not receive any funding from Oddball whatsoever. Please don't harass Luke (at least about this&mdash;go wild on your Divvy questions, he loves those).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why didn't everyone get one?</p>
            <p>While I would have loved to make more, the whole package including shipping costed around $200 a piece, so I was limited in how many I could make and send out. I tried to choose people that I knew would enjoy them. Please don't be offended if you or someone you know didn't get one.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How do I exit and/or save a game?</p>
            <p>Naturally, you can save games that have a save feature normally. However, if you use the power button and shut the device off, it will save and then resume the game when you power the device back on.<br><br>You can manually save/load game states by entering the Retroarch menu by holding the menu button and pressing select. You can get out of Retroarch by using the "resume" option in that menu.<br><br>If you want to exit a game, you can use the menu button to return to the menu, which should also create a save state (Note that this won't work for games in the "Arcade" category, which must be saved/loaded manually).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What are these cases?</p>
            <p>It's a case for the handheld. It should protect it from getting scuffed up in a bag or in your pocket. Just be careful not to forget it's in your back pocket and sit on it on accident or something.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do I need a screen protector?</p>
            <p>There should be one included in the box for the device. Feel free to apply it. I would also recommend inserting the device into the leather case with the screen facing away from the magnetic enclosure, just in case.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Did you make the leather cases yourself?</p>
            <p>While I did help design them, no I did not make them myself; I commissioned a talented leatherworker. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/deathRATTLER">You can find his store here.</a></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why are there no Nintendo 64 games?</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the device doesn't really have enough horsepower to emulate N64. Also, the controls don't really support the N64 control scheme. <br><br>However, Super Mario 64 was compiled from source recently (with modified controls) and I was at least able to include that under the PORTs section.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why is there an SD card included in the box?</p>
            <p>That is the original SD card the device came with. The quality control on those original cards is spotty and the included operating system leaves a lot to be desired. I upgraded the card on each device to a reputable brand and installed a custom linux firmware that is better supported and regularly updated.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I'm interested in this retro gaming thing, tell me more.</p>
            <p>Cool, ping me and we can talk. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps">check out this YouTube channel</a> that I learned a lot from.</p>
