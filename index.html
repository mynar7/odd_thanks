        <p>Hey, I'm Lee (you know that, we've met).</p>
        <p>I'm a big nerd, and that I'm particularly fond of <s>old</s> <em>...retro</em> video games.</p>
        <p>Recently, I discovered the retro handheld scene and learned that it's possible to fit decades of gaming history onto a single device. I thought to myself, "Wouldn't that make a great gift?"</p>
        <p>Oddball is a great company full of great people, and working for Oddball has made my life better in a lot of ways. So much so that I felt it would be nice to give back to those people that helped make my experience at Oddball great.</p>
        <p>You're one of those people, so please accept this gift!</p>

        <div>
          <p>These devices are called "retro handhelds", but basically it's a tiny Linux computer that runs emulation software for older video game consoles.</p>
          <p>There are a wide variety of different brands, components, and form factors out there, but I picked one that balances performance, portability, cost, and ease-of-use.</p>
          <p>This specific device is called the Miyoo Mini Plus, onto which I've installed a custom firmware called <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion">Onion OS</a>. I've also installed somewhere around 10,000 arcade and console games from Atari on up to Playstation 1.</p>
          <p>There's also some ports of PC games included under the PORTS folder. In there you'll find fun stuff like Doom, Duke Nukem, Cave Story, and even a port of Diablo 1 (<a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Game-Controller-Scheme">here's the controls for that</a>).</p>
          <p>For the most part, using the device is fairly straightforward. You can find the controls for Onion <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Global-Shortcuts">here</a>. If you want to dig deeper, <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Features">here's the Onion OS feature list and more info</a>. In general though, you should just be able to power it on and jump into your favorite game without much fuss.</p>
